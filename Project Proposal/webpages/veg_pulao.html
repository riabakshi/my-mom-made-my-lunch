<!--introduction paragraph-->
<div class="intro">
<p>Rice is a staple dish in India, and Pulao is a very common way of preparing it. In my household, I remember eating it at least once a week, with a plethora of different variations.
It was especially common when we were in a time crunch, because it is a super quick meal to make. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
It is simply adding spices and vegetables to the rice. It is very versatile in the way that it  is prepared. As Bhavana from Indian Veggie Delight describes in her own recipe: 
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.indianveggiedelight.com/vegetable-pulao-recipe-veg-pulao/">
I have used some of my favorite veggies in this Vegetable Pulao/Pilaf Recipe, like carrot, green beans, green peas, and cauliflower. 
You can most definitely add whatever you like â€“ mushrooms, broccoli, bell pepper, etc. 
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>
In my house, we would also swap the veggies with chickpeas, paneer, or soy nuggets. It is often served alongside yogurt, papad (almost like a thin crispy chip), and achar (spiced pickles).</p>
<br>
<p>The recipe below uses a stovetop (though it can also be made in appliances like a pressure cooker or instapot) version that uses peas and carrots.</p>
