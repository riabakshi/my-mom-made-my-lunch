<h1>Dorm Meals</h1>

<!--Introduction Paragraph-->
<div id="intro_dormmeals">
	<p>Getting good food is one of the challenges of dorm living. 
	Thankfully, if you are looking to incorporate Indian food into your dorm-diet, there are many options for you!
	</p>
</div>

<!--Quick Meals-->
<div class="dormmeals_div">
	<h2>Quick Meals</h2>
	<p>There are a few pre-packaged Indian foods that make for quick and easy meals, great for dorm living.
	My favorite is Maggi, which is similar to Ramen, just with different spices. 
	It can be made on a stove, hot plate, or even in the mircowave with just water. An assortment of veggies can be added depending on taste. 
	Follow the instructions on the back of the packet.
	<br><br>
	Other premade meal brands include Tasty Bite or Saffron Road, which both offer various assortments of meals.

<!--Indian Snacks foods-->
<div class="dormmeals_div">
	<h2>Indian Snacks</h2>
	<p>Many students are snackers while they eat. Perfect because there are many, many, many different Indian savory snacks. 
	Some of my favorite are bhujia, moong daal, channa, and sev, but there are many others on the market from biscuts to savory to sweet snacks. They are perfect to eat while you work,
	or even as a textured addition to your sandwich or meal. I know my dad used to always put bhujia in between two slices of bread for an extra crunch!</p>
