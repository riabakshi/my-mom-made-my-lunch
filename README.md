# my-mom-made-my-lunch
An HTML website created during my first programming class during sophomore year of high school (2023).

This website documents recipes passed down from my grandma to my mother and serves as a reminder that home is always with me, even at the dorms. 

A demo of the website can be accessed at the following link: https://students.imsa.edu/~rbakshi1/Project%20Proposal/index.html 


Note: there are some bugs! 
* The stylesheet is not yet responsive.
* Some of the pages lead to a page not found error...
